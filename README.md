# FlashCard App

> A simple study tool built using React.js

This study app allows users to create decks of flashcards and then go through them indivudually and study.


## Features
### Decks
This is the main page, here all the user created decks are dispayed. From this page the user can select a deck to study from, add a card to an existing deck, or create a new deck.

### Study
Once a deck is selected from the decks page, the front of the first card is displayed by default. Once the user selects "flip" the user is then allowed to move on to the next card, where the front is again displayed by default. There is also an edit button that allows the user to edit the contents of each card.

### New Deck
Here the user creates a new deck, you can create the title and then add as many cards as you want.

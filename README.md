This is the main interface with the site, here users have access to all reservation and table listings so they can clearly see the status of everything. 

### Table Status

A "finish" button appears dynamically when a reservation is seated, when the finish button is clicked the table status is updated and another reservation is allowed to be seated.

### New reservation

This component allows users to easily create new reservation. Once all required fields are filled out the time and date are validated to make sure they fall within the restaurant's operating hours
